# WEEKLY TASK

## Problem Description 

Your task is to implement a pet directory app and get it looking as close to this [design](https://www.figma.com/file/CWAmKsoR84bWgN9wvS4O9e/Coding-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1) as possible. You are to build the app ensuring your code is clean and readable with a minimum of 3 unit tests.


### Brief

- Fetch and display a list of cats/dogs (pets) from https://thecatapi.com/ or https://thedogapi.com/
- Users can "favourite" (fave) pets.
- Faved pets are cached locally(using user defaults) and displayed on another list as shown in the design.
- Write at least 3 tests for your business logic, bonus points for testing other layers such as the networking layer.
